        Phineas & Ferb was my childhood! If it was yours too, you would probably
        remember the episode where they were in their backyard and bored of
        communicating normally like everybody does, so they created their own
        language called "Ferb-latin". Basically, you add the first letter of any
        word to the last and add "erb" to the end of it. Try this with your
        fellow P&B fans!
